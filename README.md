My first coding projects as I learn Computer Science
This repository contains my very first coding programs as I begin my journey to become a software engineer.  
I am currently a Computer Science student learning **C programming** and **Python**.

## What's Inside
- Simple "Hello, World!" programs
- Small exercises from class
- My personal practice code as I learn step by step

## Goals
- Learn to write clean and readable code
- Solve at least one coding problem every day
- Share my progress publicly to inspire others
